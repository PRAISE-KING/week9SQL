# Library Management System

## Project Description
This project is a library management system that stores information about books, authors, categories, members, and borrowing records. The system allows for efficient management of books borrowed by members, authors, and the categorization of books.

## How to Set Up/Run the Project

### Step 1: Import SQL File into MySQL

1. Download the `library_management.sql` file from the repository.
2. Open MySQL Workbench (or any MySQL-compatible environment).
3. Run the following command to import the SQL file:
   ```sql
   SOURCE path_to_your_file/library_management.sql;

### 4. **Add the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**:
   - Create an ERD using a tool like [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/), or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
   - Export the ERD as an image (PNG, JPEG, etc.) or get a shareable link (if using an online tool).
   - Add the ERD image or link to your README file.

### 5. **Push the Changes**:
   - After adding the README and ERD, commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README file with project description and ERD"
     git push
     ```

### 6. **Share Your GitHub Repository Link**:
   - Once everything is pushed, copy the URL of your repository from GitHub.
   - Submit the link as per your course or assignment instructions.
